Almost 100 years later, we\u2019re proud of our thriving farms, strong communities, and happy, healthy cows that produce the rich, buttery milk that we use to make Cabot\u2019s awarding-winning cheese and dairy products. We like to think those awards mean we\u2019re doing something right. Of course, you\u2019re a big part of this too. If you love eating our cheese as much as we love making it, then we\u2019ll get to keep doing what we do for generations to come.<\/p>\r\n",
